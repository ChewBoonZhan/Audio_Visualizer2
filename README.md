## Audio Visualizer 2.0

This project is created using P5.js to visualize music. It's created for fun, and more features will be added soon ^\_^.

Note: You need to have a Xampp Apache Web Localhost, with https in order to run the code, as p5.sound.js requires it.

### Installing XAMPP

To install and use http-server, go to: [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

### Using XAMPP to run the project

1. Go to your local disk and locate "xampp"
2. Navigate to htdocs
3. Clone this project at htdocs
4. Go to localhost:8080/Audio_Visualizer2/empty-example/ to start the project. Note that the port depends on what port your Apache Web Server is on
5. Click on the canvas, and the song should start playing~

### Planned Upcoming Features (Probably, not so soon, but coming in.. September..?)
1. Adding different transition of subtitle text, it is fade out and fade in at the moment.
2. Adding small animation of sea based on perlin noise, to make the ocean move~ [Watch Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB1hWWedMk)
3. Adding a lighthouse in the background, which rotates light (Need to convert project to WEBGL for 3D)
